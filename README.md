# FlightPlanner

● Developed a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm with a stack designed to compute all paths, ordered
shortest to longest, between two cities pulled from a graph edges file.  
● Implemented bidirectional edge support to simulate omnidirectional city connections, ensuring
exhaustive path exploration within a graph structure.  
● Enabled user specification for Minimum Time Cost or Minimum Monetary Cost
● Written in Java, graph implemented as adjacency list.  


Overview
This repository contains the source code for Flight Planner, a project completed as part of my coursework at the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD). The project was developed to demonstrate my understanding of Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures as well as a testiment to my conforability with Java. The code is shared here for the purpose of showcasing my work to potential employers and others interested in my development skills.  
  
Purpose  
This repository is intended to:  
  
Provide a portfolio of my work for interviewers and potential employers.  
Demonstrate my skills in Alogorithm design  
Serve as a reference for my own future projects and continued learning.
