# FlightPlanner

● Developed a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm with a stack designed to compute all paths, ordered
shortest to longest, between two cities pulled from a graph edges file.  
● Implemented bidirectional edge support to simulate omnidirectional city connections, ensuring
exhaustive path exploration within a graph structure.  
● Enabled user specification for Minimum Time Cost or Minimum Monetary Cost
● Written in Java, graph implemented as adjacency list.
